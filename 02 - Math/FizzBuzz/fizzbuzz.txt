Given a positive integer N, print all the integers from 1 to N. But for multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print “Buzz”. Also for number which are multiple of 3 and 5, prints “FizzBuzz”.

Example

N = 5
Return: [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]

Note: Instead of printing the answer, you have to return it as list of strings.
